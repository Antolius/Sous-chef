Thick, hearty and creamy Vegan Potato Soup. It is really simple to make and very budget friendly. You can enjoy it just as it is, or get crazy with toppings. I like to finish mine off with some crumbled tempeh bacon, crispy roasted potato chunks & a sprinkle of parsley for a pop of colour!

- *2 tablespoons* vegan butter , or olive oil, or to make oil-free omit and use a few tablespoons of water for sautéing instead
- *2 medium* onions , chopped finely
- *2 ribs* celery , diced
- *2 large* carrots , diced
- *4 cloves* garlic , chopped finely
- *2 teaspoons* salt , plus more to taste
- *0.5 teaspoon* ground black pepper , plus more to taste
- *4 tablespoons* all purpose flour , or gluten-free all purpose flour
- *480 ml* non dairy milk , cashew milk or soy milk are my milks of choice for savory recipes but any other unsweetened creamy non-dairy milk will work too
- *650 ml* flavourful vegetable broth/stock , divided
- *700 g* potatoes , cut into ½ inch cubes
- *0.25 teaspoon* ground nutmeg , (optional)
- *1* bay leaf

---

1. To a large saucepan, add the vegan butter/oil and warm over a medium heat before adding the onions, celery and carrots. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions are just starting to get a little colour, then add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.
2. Add the salt and pepper, then the flour to the pan and stir it all around for about a minute to cook the raw flour taste out, then slowly add the soy milk, stirring as you go to work out any lumps. Then add the vegetable broth (reserving about ½ a cup / 120 mls) , chopped potatoes, nutmeg and the bay leaf.
3. Stir really well then let it simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft and just starting to break down. Add all of, or some of, the reserved ½ a cup / 120 mls of broth if you prefer a thinner consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

## Recipe Notes

It is normal for the soup to thicken as it cools.
Soup reheats really well. Thin with more broth or water if it becomes a little thick.'),
